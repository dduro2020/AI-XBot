## Welcome !!
I want to use the X (formerly Twitter) API to explore how AI adapts to human interaction by analyzing real-time social media engagement. My goal is to understand patterns in communication, sentiment, and content trends as part of a broader educational project. By leveraging the API, I aim to gather data that will help illustrate how AI can learn from and respond to dynamic human behavior, ultimately enriching educational resources on the intersection of technology and social interaction. This project is strictly for educational purposes, focused on enhancing our understanding of AI's role in modern communication.
